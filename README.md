# Studying Trends in U.S. Wage Inequality
## Overview
This is a partial recreation of the Autor, Katz, Kearney 2008 paper studying Trends in U.S. Wage Inequality. It recreates Figure 4 and Table 2 of Section III in the paper exploring the College/ High School Wage Differential. It also calculates the year in which the growth trend in the relative supply of college workers is broken causing the Katz-Murphy model to overpredict the wage differential.
